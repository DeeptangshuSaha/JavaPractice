1) Integer x is a null object ddeclaration which is allowed by the compiler but int x refers to a variable of primitive type int and it cannot be left empty.
2) 2 becuase it is not explicitly upcasted.
3) -128 as it overflows
4) in c==d it is actually equals that is to be used to compare as it is above the range which can be checked using a direct comparison
5) x=5 is an assignment which will always evaluate to true and the body being empty means it will not update during runtime thus becoming an infinite loop
6) A or error since there are multiple lines under the first if without braces
7) when the cases are all of same type and straight forward. 
8) Done
9) do-while runs the loop body atleast once before evaluating the condition
10) if the loop had been started by 0 it would have printed an empty line first before printing the rest of the pattern
11) break exits the loop and stops the loop execution but continue just skips over that particular interpretation when encountered
12) then all the conditions after the matching conditions are printed

2) 2.0 because 5/2 returns the aswer 2 and the it is upcasted into 2.0.

4) a==b is true because they are under the limit and hence point to the same object in the pool but c==d is false because it is outside the limit and hence are two different objects thus not the same.

5) The x=5 is an assignment operator and does not return anything hence it will be a CTE.

6) A the conditions are all true and the syntax is also correct

8) Done. Since the semicolon stops the for loop from execution and  the println line just prints the string before going to the newline and the code is finished.

9) do-while runs the loop body atleast once before evaluating the condition a bug would be in a menu driven program the loop should run atleast once to take the input for the first time brfore directly starting to evaluate.

11) break -> breaks out of the current loop under where it is encountered.
continue -> it skips the ongoing iteration of the current loop and goes to the next iteration.
