# 📘 JavaPractice

This repository contains structured Java practice focused on clean code organization, package-based design, and backend-oriented thinking rather than standalone scripts.

The goal is to build strong fundamentals that transition naturally into Spring Boot and backend development.


▶️ Build & Run

* Compile all sources:

  jb -> a custom script to compile all the java files.


* Run a specific program:

  jr mission{num}.micromission{num}.ProgramA

# 🎯 Design Principles Followed

* Package-based organization over file-based

# 🚀 Future Direction

This structure is intentionally stuctured package based to follow spring like organisation, enabling a smooth transition to:

* Spring Like Separation of Concern

* Maven

* JUnit testing
